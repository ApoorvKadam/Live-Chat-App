# Live-Chat-App
This app helps you to perform a real-time chatting experience. We have to make a server listen to port 8080 and we use JSON for exchanging the data between client and server.  You need to copy the socket js file in your chat directory to run it.\
This project keeps asking you about the plugins update, so keep your internet alive. And moreover, you will need to update your SDK version and also you have to update your instant run plugins.
